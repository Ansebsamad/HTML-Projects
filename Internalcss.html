   <p>The human activity that surrounds aircraft is called aviation. The science of aviation, including designing and
    building aircraft, is called aeronautics. Crewed aircraft are flown by an onboard pilot, whereas unmanned aerial
    vehicles may be remotely controlled or self-controlled by onboard computers. Aircraft may be classified by different
    criteria, such as lift type, aircraft propulsion (if any), usage and others.</p>
