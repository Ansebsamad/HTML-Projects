        Kerala was alternatively called Malabar in the foreign trade circles. Earlier, the term Malabar had also been
        used to denote Tulu Nadu and Kanyakumari which lie contiguous to Kerala on the southwestern coast of India, in
        addition to the modern state of Kerala. The people of Malabar were known as Malabars. Until the arrival of the
        East India Company, the term Malabar was used as a general name for Kerala, along with the term Kerala.
