        A ship is a large vessel that travels the world's oceans and other navigable waterways, carrying cargo or
        passengers, or in support of specialized missions, such as defense, research and fishing. Ships are generally
        distinguished from boats, based on size, shape, load capacity and purpose. Ships have supported exploration,
        trade, warfare, migration, colonization, and science. Ship transport is responsible for the largest portion of
        world commerce.
