    <h1>Rectangle</h1>
    <p>
        In Euclidean plane geometry, a rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles. It can also be defined as:
        an equiangular quadrilateral, since equiangular means that all of its angles are equal (360°/4 = 90°); or a
        parallelogram containing a right angle. A rectangle with four sides of equal length is a square. The term
        "oblong" is occasionally used to refer to a non-square rectangle.[1][2][3] A rectangle with vertices ABCD would
        be denoted as ABCD.
